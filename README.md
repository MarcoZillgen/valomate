# VALOMATE
## Overview
Valomate is your go-to platform for finding the perfect mates for your Valorant matches. Say goodbye to random queuing and prolonged waits on Discord! With Valomate, you can swiftly find teammates who match your preferences, speak your language, and are within your rank range, whether in your region or beyond. Dive into a seamless gaming experience where you can view player stats and decide who aligns with your gaming style.

## Search Mechanism
Valomate offers a customizable search experience, allowing you to create groups and tailor your search settings to include preferences such as ranks, servers, voice chat, and more. Once you initiate a search and find potential mates, you can invite them to your group. The invited group receives a notification and can review your stats, just as you did with theirs. Upon mutual acceptance, the groups merge into one, setting the stage for an exciting gaming session.

For those utilizing the Discord bot, linking your Discord accounts enables you to directly join the same voice chat, ensuring smooth communication among teammates. This feature aims to work seamlessly, enhancing your gaming interactions.
